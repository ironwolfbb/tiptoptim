/**
 * Abstract class agent for development simple workers.
 *
 * Algorithm of agent execution:
 * 1. Bitrix launches method `Agent::agent()->run()`. Your agents should be registered in the same format:
 * `\Vendor\Packeage\ClassName::agent()->run();`. All arguments from this method will be duplicated to the
 * object constructor:
 * `agent($arg1, …, $arg2)` → `__construct($arg1, …, $arg2)`.
 * 2. Create an object of agent class.
 * 3. Call `init()` method. It is needed for some initial operations, for example: loading required modules.
 * 4. Call `execute()` method. This will execute main agent's logic.
